# Deploying and Experimenting with DeepSeek LLMs: Cost-Optimized Pathways  

Below is a structured plan for deploying DeepSeek models affordably in the cloud while preserving a pathway for future fine-tuning and training.  

---

## **Phase 1: Initial Deployment (Low-Cost Testing)**  

### **Recommended Platforms**  
#### 1. **Hugging Face Inference Endpoints**  
- **Model**: `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1` (7B/14B variants)  
- **Hardware**:  
  - **T4 GPU** ($0.50/hr): Suitable for basic inference/testing.  
  - **A10G GPU** ($1.00/hr): Faster responses for iterative experimentation.  
- **Deployment Steps**:  
  ```python  
  from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient  
  client = InferenceClient(token="YOUR_HF_TOKEN")  
  response = client.text_generation(  
      model="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-7B",  
      inputs="Texas Hold'em solver prompt...",  
      max_new_tokens=256  
  )  
  ```
- **Cost**: ~$0.50–$1.50/day for intermittent usage.  

#### 2. **Replicate (Pay-Per-Second)**  
- **Model**: Host DeepSeek-R1 via Cog (custom Docker container).  
- **Pricing**:  
  - **Nvidia T4**: $0.000225/sec (~$0.81/hr)  
  - **A100 (80GB)**: $0.0032/sec (~$11.52/hr)  
- **Advantage**: Scales to zero when idle, ideal for sporadic testing.  

#### 3. **Vast.ai (Spot Instances)**  
- **Instance**: RTX 6000 (48GB VRAM) at **$0.50/hr** (interruptible).  
- **Setup**:  
  ```bash  
  docker run -p 7860:7860 --gpus all deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-7B  
  ```
- **Use Case**: Cheapest option for extended sessions (>4 hrs/day).  

---

## **Phase 2: Fine-Tuning and Training (Future-Proofing)**  

### **Cost-Effective Training Platforms**  
#### 1. **Lambda Labs**  
- **Instance**: 8x H100 (80GB) at **$2.99/GPU/hr** (reserved pricing).  
- **Fine-Tuning Workflow**:  
  - Use Hugging Face’s `trl` library with QLoRA:  
  ```python  
  from peft import LoraConfig  
  config = LoraConfig(r=64, lora_alpha=16, target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"])  
  trainer = SFTTrainer(  
      model=model,  
      train_dataset=dataset,  
      peft_config=config,  
      args=TrainingArguments(per_device_train_batch_size=4)  
  )  
  ```
- **Cost**: ~$95.68/day (8x H100).  

#### 2. **Vast.ai (Spot GPUs for RLHF)**  
- **Instance**: 4x A100 (80GB) at **$2.30/GPU/hr** (interruptible).  
- **Use Case**: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) at 1/3 the cost of on-demand clouds.  

#### 3. **Hugging Face AutoTrain**  
- **Service**: Managed fine-tuning for $0.0035/GPU-sec (~$12.60/hr for A100).  
- **Integration**: Directly deploy trained models to Inference Endpoints.

## **Cost Comparison Table**  
| Task               | Platform       | Hardware       | Cost Estimate      |  
|--------------------|----------------|----------------|--------------------|  
| Initial Inference  | Hugging Face   | T4 GPU         | $0.50/hr           |  
| Batch Inference    | Vast.ai        | RTX 6000       | $0.50/hr (spot)    |  
| QLoRA Fine-Tuning  | Lambda Labs    | 8x H100        | $2.99/GPU/hr       |  
| Full RLHF Training | Vast.ai        | 4x A100        | $9.20/hr (spot)    |  

---

## **Strategic Recommendations**  
1. **Start with Hugging Face Inference Endpoints**: Minimal setup, integrates with future training workflows.  
2. **Transition to Vast.ai for Fine-Tuning**: Leverage spot instances to reduce costs by 50–70%.  
3. **Use Open-R1 Toolkit**: The [Open-R1 GitHub repo](https://github.com/huggingface/open-r1) provides prebuilt scripts for distilling DeepSeek-R1 into smaller models (e.g., Llama-3-8B), cutting future training costs.  

---

## **Example Cost Breakdown**  
- **Week 1 (Testing)**:  
  - 2 hrs/day on Hugging Face T4 = 14 hrs × $0.50 = **$7.00**  
- **Week 2–4 (Fine-Tuning)**:  
  - 48 hrs on Vast.ai A100 spot = 48 × $2.30 = **$110.40**  
- **Total Month 1**: **~$117.40**  

For comparison, equivalent AWS p4d instances would cost **$1,200+** for the same workload.  

---

## **Critical Considerations**  
- **Data Preparation**: Use the [Poker Hand Histories dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/poker-ai/hand-histories) for poker-specific fine-tuning.  
- **Quantization**: Apply GPTQ/AWQ to shrink DeepSeek-R1-7B to 4-bit for 2x faster inference on T4 GPUs.  
- **Monitoring**: Track GPU utilization with `nvtop` to avoid overprovisioning.  

By starting with low-cost inference and strategically scaling to spot instances for training, you can minimize upfront investment while retaining flexibility for advanced customization.
